# README

This repository is an accompaniment to the book chapter on "Voice presentation attack detection using
convolutional neural networks". It contains the code used to generate the results in the paper.

This README briefly describes 3 directories in this repository.
They are:

- ``matlab_AlexNet``: to produce the AlexNet results
- ``pytorch/``: to train and test the CNN based system implemented in Pytoch
- ``tensorflow/``: to train and test the CNN based system implemented in Tensorflow

Each directory has a separate README to get the code working.
